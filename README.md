# nlp_final

This is the README for the NLP final project.

We created a Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab in order to create the model. To reproduce the results, load the ipynb file on Google Colab and run all results. You will need a WandB api key for the training logs. The notebook has the code for the baseline and model music recommendation generation.
